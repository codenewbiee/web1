<h1>HTML이란 무엇인가</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/" target="_blank" title="HTML spcification">HTML, or HyperText Markup Language</a>, is a markup language used to describe the structure of a web page. It uses a <strong>special <u>syntax</u> or notation</strong> to organize and give information about the page to the browser. Elements usually have opening and closing tags that surround and give meaning to content. For example, there are different tag options to place around text to show whether it is a heading, a paragraph, or a list.</p>

<p>The HyperText part of HTML comes from the early days of the web and its original use case.</p><p style="margin-top:40px;"> Pages usually contained static documents that contained references to other documents. These references contained hypertext links used by the browser to navigate to the reference document so the user could read the reference document without having to manually search for it.</P>
